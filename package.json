  "description": "Web authentication (WebAuthn) is a modern, secure standard for authenticating users on websites and apps without relying on traditional passwords. It uses biometrics (like fingerprints or facial recognition), hardware security keys, or device-based methods to verify user identity. WebAuthn enhances security by reducing risks of phishing, password leaks, and brute-force attacks.",
